# Value Objects Integration

A [Purview.ValueObjects](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Purview.ValueObjects) **scalar** is a strongly typed wrapper around a single value (`AssetId` around a `Guid`, `TenantId` around a `Guid`, `EmailAddress` around a `string`, and so on). Because a scalar *is* one value, ZodSharp validates it as a unit — not through its `Value` property — and reports the failure with an **empty path**.

This page shows how to wire the `[Scalar]` generation to the `[ZodSchema]` generation, the two shapes a custom rule can take, and how the rule's error code and message are defined. For the general rule contract, see [Custom Rules](Custom-Rules.md).

## Prerequisites and wiring

Reference both packages:

```bash
dotnet add package Purview.ValueObjects
dotnet add package Purview.ZodSharp
```

A scalar is declared with the `[Scalar]` attribute (from `Purview.ValueObjects.Serialization`) and given a ZodSharp schema with `[ZodSchema]`. The type must be `partial`:

```csharp
using Purview.ValueObjects.Serialization;
using ZodSharp;

namespace ChangeOps;

[Scalar]
[ZodSchema]
public readonly partial record struct AssetId
{
    public Guid Value { get; init; }
}
```

Each attribute brings in a different generator:

| Attribute | Generator | What it emits |
|---|---|---|
| `[Scalar]` | **Purview.ValueObjects** | the `IScalarValueObject<TSelf, TValue>` implementation (and, when `Purview.ZodSharp` is referenced, the `ScalarRuleAdapter<TSelf, TValue, TRule>` used below) |
| `[ZodSchema]` | **Purview.ZodSharp** | the static `AssetIdSchema` validator (`Validate`/`Parse`, and so on) |

The underlying member defaults to a public property named `Value`. Rename it with the attribute argument and the value-objects generator follows:

```csharp
[Scalar("Id")]
[ZodSchema]
public readonly partial record struct TenantId
{
    public Guid Id { get; init; }
}
```

Scalars implement the two-type-parameter contract:

```csharp
namespace Purview.ValueObjects;

public interface IScalarValueObject<TSelf, TValue> : IValueObject, IComparable<TSelf>, IComparable
    where TSelf : IScalarValueObject<TSelf, TValue>
{
    TValue Value { get; }
    static abstract TSelf Create(TValue value);
    static abstract TSelf Hydrate(TValue value);
    int CompareTo(TValue other);
}
```

so `AssetId` is `IScalarValueObject<AssetId, Guid>`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The ZodSharp generator discovers a scalar through the source-visible `[Scalar]` attribute and the public property it names — it does not depend on the `IScalarValueObject<TSelf, TValue>` interface, because that interface is contributed by another generator and may not be visible as a symbol in the same compilation pass.

> [!NOTE]
> The `ScalarRuleAdapter<TSelf, TValue, TRule>` type is emitted into your compilation by the **Purview.ValueObjects** generator whenever the project references both `Purview.ValueObjects` and `Purview.ZodSharp`. Do not declare it yourself. If the value-objects generator is disabled (`DisableValueObjectsSourceGenerator`), the adapter is not emitted and the generated validator will not compile.

## Two ways to attach a rule to a scalar

There are two shapes, and the generator picks the right one from the rule's own constraints:

1. **A rule written against the value object** (`where TSelf : IScalarValueObject<TSelf, TValue>`) closes over the scalar itself, so it can read state through the value-object contract.
2. **A rule written against the underlying value** (`IValidationRule<TValue>`) is **adapted automatically**: the generator reads the scalar's property, closes the rule with the underlying value, and wraps it in `ScalarRuleAdapter` so the rule still runs against the value object as a unit. One rule then serves every scalar backed by the same primitive.

In both cases the rule is attached at the **type level** — put the attribute on the scalar type, not on its `Value` property — and the reported error has an **empty path**:

```text
Code    = "invalid_asset_id"
Message = "AssetId must not be empty."
Origin  = "value_object"
Path    = []
```

> [!TIP]
> `ZodSharp.Rules.NonSentinelRule<T>` and its generated `ZodSharp.Rules.NonSentinelAttribute` ship with `Purview.ZodSharp`, so the canonical non-sentinel case is available as `[NonSentinel(Message = "…")]` on a `[Scalar]` type without defining anything yourself. The walkthroughs below use local rules (`NotEmptyRule<T>`, `MyRules.NonSentinelRule<T>`) to show the full shape.

Type-level attributes need `AttributeTargets.Class | AttributeTargets.Struct` (and usually `Property`/`Field` too, so the same attribute can validate a primitive member). A generated attribute already carries all five targets:

```csharp
[ZodRule(typeof(NotEmptyRule<>))]
[AttributeUsage(AttributeTargets.Class | AttributeTargets.Struct | AttributeTargets.Property)]
public sealed class NotEmptyAttribute : ValidationAttribute
{
    public string? Code { get; set; }
    public string? Message { get; set; }
}
```

## Error code and message definitions

Every rule **should** expose its error identity as public constants so consumers and tests can assert against the rule rather than re-typing literals:

```csharp
public const string ErrorCode = "invalid_value";
public const string MessageFormat = "Value must not be empty.";
```

- `ErrorCode` is the rule's canonical code — the value a test compares against (`Assert.That(error.Code).IsEqualTo(NotEmptyRule<AssetId>.ErrorCode)`).
- `MessageFormat` is a `string.Format` template. `{0}` (and `{1}`, …) are the offending value and any rule-specific arguments; use it with `string.Format(CultureInfo.CurrentCulture, MessageFormat, …)`.
- The constants may be inherited from a base rule class, and **abstract bases are exempt**, so a shared base can host them for its concrete derivations.

A rule that omits either constant is reported as **ZODSGEN042** (a warning).

### Runtime identity: `IZodRule`

The constants are the *static* default. When a single attribute must produce a different code per annotated scalar, the rule implements `ZodSharp.Core.IZodRule` and supplies its own code/origin at runtime:

```csharp
public interface IZodRule
{
    string? Code { get; }     // null falls back to the attribute-mapped code
    string? Origin { get; }   // null falls back to the attribute-mapped origin
}
```

The generated code reads the identity through an `IZodRule` cast, preferring the rule over the mapped attribute values. A rule that accepts a `code`/`origin` constructor parameter **without** implementing `IZodRule` never reaches the reported error identity and is reported as **ZODSGEN039**.

The full precedence for the reported code and origin (first match wins):

1. **Rule-owned** — the rule implements `IZodRule`, so its `Code`/`Origin` are used at runtime (the mapped values are only a fallback when the rule returns `null`).
2. **Attribute-declared** — a `Code` / `Origin` named argument on the applied attribute (for example `[NotEmpty(Code = "invalid_asset_id")]`).
3. **Attribute-type mapping** — `[ZodRule(typeof(X), Code = "…", Origin = "…")]`.
4. **Default** — `validation_failed`, with no origin.

### Message overrides

The reported message is resolved in this order:

1. A `message` argument on the rule (typically a `Message` constructor parameter), when set.
2. The attribute's `ErrorMessage` / `ErrorMessageResourceName` / `ErrorMessageResourceType`, mapped to a constructor parameter named `message`.
3. `GetErrorMessage(value)`, which formats `MessageFormat` with the offending value.

`MessageFormat` is therefore the fallback, not the only message.

### Rule against the value object

Define one generic rule per underlying primitive, close it over the scalar, and implement `IZodRule` so each scalar keeps its own code:

```csharp
// MyRules/NotEmptyRule.cs — a rules library that references Purview.ValueObjects
using System.Globalization;
using ZodSharp.Core;

namespace MyRules;

public readonly record struct NotEmptyRule<TSelf>(string? Code = null, string? Message = null)
    : IValidationRule<TSelf>, IZodRule
    where TSelf : IScalarValueObject<TSelf, Guid>
{
    public const string ErrorCode = "invalid_value";
    public const string MessageFormat = "Value must not be empty.";

    public bool IsValid(in TSelf value) => value.Value != Guid.Empty;

    public string GetErrorMessage(in TSelf value) =>
        Message ?? string.Format(CultureInfo.CurrentCulture, MessageFormat);

    string? IZodRule.Code => Code;
    string? IZodRule.Origin => "value_object";
}
```

```csharp
// Purview.ChangeOps
using MyRules;
using Purview.ValueObjects.Serialization;
using ZodSharp;

[Scalar]
[ZodSchema]
[NotEmpty(Code = "invalid_asset_id", Message = "AssetId must not be empty.")]
public readonly partial record struct AssetId
{
    public Guid Value { get; init; }
}

[Scalar]
[ZodSchema]
[NotEmpty(Code = "invalid_external_identity_id", Message = "ExternalIdentityId must not be empty.")]
public readonly partial record struct ExternalIdentityId
{
    public Guid Value { get; init; }
}
```

Because the rule closes over `TSelf` (`NotEmptyRule<AssetId>`), it sees the value object and reads `Value` through the `IScalarValueObject<TSelf, Guid>` constraint. A generic rule must have exactly one type parameter, so the underlying value type is pinned by the constraint — define one rule per primitive (`NotEmptyRule<TSelf> where TSelf : IScalarValueObject<TSelf, Guid>`, a `long` variant, and so on). This rule is **not** adapted: a rule whose constraint asks for the scalar keeps closing over the value object.

### Rule against the underlying value (adapted)

A rule written against the value (`IValidationRule<Guid>`) is adapted automatically when applied to a `[Scalar]` type, so one rule serves every scalar backed by that primitive:

```csharp
// MyRules/NonSentinelRule.cs — a rule written against the value, not the value object
using System;
using System.Globalization;
using ZodSharp.Core;

namespace MyRules;

public readonly record struct NonSentinelRule<T>(string? Message = null)
    : IValidationRule<T>, IZodRule
    where T : IEquatable<T>
{
    public const string ErrorCode = "invalid_value";
    public const string MessageFormat = "Value is a sentinel value, but got {0}";

    public bool IsValid(in T value) => !value.Equals(default(T)!);

    public string GetErrorMessage(in T value) =>
        Message ?? string.Format(CultureInfo.CurrentCulture, MessageFormat, value);

    string? IZodRule.Code => ErrorCode;
    string? IZodRule.Origin => "value_object";
}
```

```csharp
[Scalar]
[ZodSchema]
[NonSentinel(Message = "AssetId must not be empty.")]
public readonly partial record struct AssetId
{
    public Guid Value { get; init; }
}
```

The generator emits the rule against `Guid` and wraps it in the adapter the value-objects generator emits:

```csharp
var assetIdCustomRuleInner0 = new global::MyRules.NonSentinelRule<global::System.Guid>("AssetId must not be empty.");
var assetIdCustomRule0 = new global::Purview.ValueObjects.ScalarRuleAdapter<global::ChangeOps.AssetId, global::System.Guid, global::MyRules.NonSentinelRule<global::System.Guid>>(assetIdCustomRuleInner0);
if (!assetIdCustomRule0.IsValid(value))
{
    (errors ??= new List<ValidationError>()).Add(
        ValidationError.Create(
            ((global::ZodSharp.Core.IZodRule)assetIdCustomRuleInner0).Code ?? "validation_failed",
            assetIdCustomRule0.GetErrorMessage(value),
            EmptyPath,
            origin: ((global::ZodSharp.Core.IZodRule)assetIdCustomRuleInner0).Origin));
}
```

The reported error keeps the **empty path**, and the error identity (`Code`/`Origin`) is read from the **wrapped** rule, not the adapter.

> [!NOTE]
> If the type has no value-object contract (a plain class with a `Guid` property), the property-level form still works: map the attribute to an `IValidationRule<Guid>` and put it on `Value`. See [Exposing a rule as a DataAnnotations attribute](Custom-Rules.md#exposing-a-rule-as-a-dataannotations-attribute) and [Generic rules](Custom-Rules.md#generic-rules).

## Testing

Assert against the rule's constants instead of duplicating literals, and remember that an adapted scalar rule reads its identity from the wrapped rule:

```csharp
// Direct scalar rule — the runtime identity comes from IZodRule or the attribute mapping.
var directError = AssetIdSchema.Validate(default).Errors[0];

await Assert.That(directError.Code).IsEqualTo("invalid_asset_id");
await Assert.That(directError.Message).IsEqualTo("AssetId must not be empty.");
await Assert.That(directError.Origin).IsEqualTo("value_object");
await Assert.That(directError.Path.Length).IsEqualTo(0);

// Adapted underlying-value rule — the canonical identity is the wrapped rule's constant.
var adaptedError = TenantIdSchema.Validate(default).Errors[0];

await Assert.That(adaptedError.Code).IsEqualTo(NonSentinelRule<Guid>.ErrorCode); // "invalid_value"
await Assert.That(adaptedError.Message).IsEqualTo("TenantId must not be empty."); // attribute override

// With no Message override, the rule's MessageFormat is the message:
await Assert.That(
    string.Format(CultureInfo.CurrentCulture, NonSentinelRule<Guid>.MessageFormat, Guid.Empty))
    .IsEqualTo("Value is a sentinel value, but got 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000");
```

## Diagnostics and troubleshooting

| ID | Severity | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| ZODSGEN030 | Error | The mapped rule does not implement `IValidationRule<T>` for the target type, or an unbound generic rule could not be closed with it. |
| ZODSGEN033 | Warning | A rule-mapped attribute is applied to a type that gets no generated schema (no `[ZodSchema]` and not reachable as a complex property), so the rule never runs. |
| ZODSGEN039 | Warning | A rule accepts a `code`/`origin` constructor parameter but does not implement `IZodRule`, so the value never reaches the reported error identity. |
| ZODSGEN040 | Warning | An attribute argument has no effect: the resolved rule has no matching constructor parameter and the value is not part of the reported error identity. |
| ZODSGEN042 | Warning | A rule does not expose public `const string ErrorCode` / `MessageFormat` constants. |

Common causes:

- **The rule never runs.** The scalar is missing `[ZodSchema]` (ZODSGEN033), or `[ZodSchema(GenerateValidateMethod = false)]` omitted the `Validate` method that hosts type-level rules.
- **The validator does not compile.** `DisableValueObjectsSourceGenerator` disabled the adapter; re-enable it, or express the rule against the value object so no adapter is needed.
- **The wrong rule shape resolved.** A rule constrained to `IScalarValueObject<TSelf, TValue>` is never adapted; a rule written against the underlying value is always adapted. If a family member cannot validate the target type, ZODSGEN030 is reported and nothing is emitted.
