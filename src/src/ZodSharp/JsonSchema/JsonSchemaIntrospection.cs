/// Kept separate from <see cref="IJsonSchemaInnerSchema"/> because the two mean different things to the

/// <c>required</c> list — so it is simply unwrapped. A nullable schema changes the exported shape to
/// <c>anyOf: [inner, {"type": "null"}]</c>, so it must be recognised rather than unwrapped.
